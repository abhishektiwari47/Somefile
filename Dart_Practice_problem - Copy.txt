Problem 1 :- Create a class Sum. It will have two integers, A and B and a method addition(). addition() will return the sum of the values of A and B.
Create an object of Sum and pass the values of A and B and print its sum using the addition() method. 

                  // e.g., Input : A = 4 , B = 9
                             Output : 13

                  // e.g., Input : A = 5 , B = 8
                             Output : 13

Problem 2 :- Create a class called Birds. It will have one string attribute, color. There will be a method also which will check if the bird's color is blue or white or black and return the color's value otherwise it will return "May Be Some Other Color". 
Create an object and pass the value of color given by the user using constructor and print the result returned by the method as output.

                  // e.g., Input : Color = black
                             Output : black

                  // e.g., Input : Color = green
                             Output : May Be Some Other Color

Problem 3 :- Create a class Calc. It will have three integers A, B and C and two methods add() and mul(). add() will return the sum of any two values passed to it. mul() will return the multiplication of three values given to it.
Create two objects, obj1 and obj2. In constructor for obj1 pass only A and B as parameters and print their sum and in constructor for obj2 pass A, B and C as parameters and print multiplication for them.

                  // e.g., Input : X = 4 , Y = 2 , Z = 4
                             Output : obj1 = 6
                                           obj2 =  32

                  // e.g., Input : X = 3 , Y = 5 , Z = 2
                             Output : obj1 = 8
                                           obj2 = 30

Problem 4 :-Create two classes Call and Mobile. 
Call will contain a method, calling() which will just print "Calling Button Pressed". Mobile will contain a method, disconnect() which will just print "Call Disconnection Button Pressed". 
Create an object of Mobile namely dialPad which can use dialPad for calling() method. User will give 1 or 0 as input. For 1 call calling() method for 0 call disconnect() method.

                  // e.g., Input : X = 1
                             Output : Calling Button Pressed

                  // e.g., Input : X = 0
                             Output : 

Problem 5 :-Create three classes: French, English, and Speak.
In Speak there will be a method named talk() and it will just print "Talking in some language". 
Class English will have a talk() method too but it will print "Talking in english". Class French will have a talk() method too but it will print "Talking in french". 
User will give 0,1 or 2 for calling talk() method of different classes.


                  // e.g., Input : X = 0
                             Output : Talking in some language
 
                  // e.g., Input : 1
                             Output : Talking in english                                    
                                              
Problem 6 :- Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'detBalance'. $100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method name 'getBalance'. Creating an object of each of the three classes. And call the getBalace() method for 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' according to the input by user as 0, 1 or 2.
 
                  // e.g., Input : X = 0
                             Output : $100
 
                  // e.g., Input : 2
                             Output : $200
